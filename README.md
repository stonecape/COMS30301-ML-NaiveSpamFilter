# Naive Bayes spam filter
##Subtask1-simple Naive Bayes spam filter
- Use very simple data preprocessing (like stopwords) so that the emails can be read into the Naive Bayes 
- Write simple Naive Bayes multinomial classifier
- Classify the data
- Choose a baseline and compare our classifier against it

##Subtask 2 - Improve the simple Naive Bayes spam filter
- Use some smart feature processing techniques (Word stemming and Weighted Frequency and Odds (WFO)) to improve the classification results
- Compare the classification results with and without these techniques

##Subtask 3 - Calibration and Naive Bayes extension
- Adaboosting
- Unknown tokens
- Graham’s Method
